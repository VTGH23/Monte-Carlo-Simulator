# Synopsis
## Install
Clone the repository (https://github.com/VTGH23/Monte-Carlo-Simulator) to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory of the repository within the file structure of your machine, then execute the following code at the command line (assumes you have pip installed) 

```
pip install .
```
You can also try executing the following code using Windows Command Prompt.

```
python -m pip install .
```

## Import
Execute the code below to import the relevant classes from the montecarlo module for use in a .py file or jupyter notebook.

```
from montecarlo import Die
from montecarlo import Game
from montecarlo import Analyzer
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## Creating dice
Create a Die object with the Die class by passing a numpy array of faces (str or numeric). In this example, we choose a numpy array (str) using the sides of a typical Die.

```
demo_Die_object_1 = Die(np.array(['one','two','three','four','five','six']))
```

A weight array (numeric) is initialized when creating a Die object. By default all weights are 1, but you can change weights for a particular face value using the change_weight() method (see API description for additional detail on all methods for all classes in the package). Change_weight() takes two arguments, the face value whose weight will be changed, and the new weight (numeric).

Below we change the weight of the 'one' face to 5. (Weights for faces 'two','three','four','five','six' remain 1 by default).

```
demo_Die_object_1 = Die(np.array(['one','two','three','four','five','six']))
demo_Die_object_1.change_weight('one',5)
```

You can roll a Die object to generate a random vector of faces based on the current set of weights. The roll() method takes an int for the number of rolls (i.e., expected length of the random vector of faces).

```
print(demo_Die_object_1.roll(5))
```

Use the show_current() method to return a dataframe of the current faces and weights for a particular Die object.

```
print(demo_Die_object_1.show_current())
```

## Playing games

Create a Game object with the Game class by passing a list of already instantiated Die objects.

```
demo_Game_object_1 = Game([Die(np.array(['one','two','three','four','five','six'])),Die(np.array(['one','two','three','four','five','six']))])
```

Similar to the roll() method in the Die class, a Game object can use the play() method to roll each Die and save results in an N rolls x M dice dataframe. The play() method takes an int input for the number of plays.

```
demo_Game_object_1.play(10)
```

You can see results of the most recent play by using the show() method. show() takes an input for the form of the returned dataframe ('wide' or 'narrow' forms).
The narrow form of the dataframe will have a two-column index with the roll number and the die number, and a column for the face rolled.
The wide form of the dataframe will a single column index with the roll number, and each die number as a column.

```
print(demo_Game_object_1.show('wide'))
```

## Analyzing games
Create an Analyzer object with the Analyzer class by passing an already instantiated Game object.

```
demo_Analyzer_object_1 = Analyzer(demo_Game_object_1)
```

Analyzer has a few useful methods that give you additional detail on the results of the Game. The jackpot() method counts how many times all Die faces were rolled the same over the course of the game. It returns an integer and stores results as a dataframe in a public attribute.

```
print(demo_Analyzer_object_1.jackpot())
```

The combo() method computes the distinct combinations of faces rolled, along with their counts. It stores these results as a dataframe in a public attribute.

```
demo_Analyzer_object_1.combo()
print(demo_Analyzer_object_1.combo_results_index)
```

The face_counts_per_roll() method computes how many times a given face is rolled in each event. It stores the results as a dataframe in a public attribute.

```
demo_Analyzer_object_1.face_counts_per_roll()
print(demo_Analyzer_object_1.face_counts_per_roll_results)
```
